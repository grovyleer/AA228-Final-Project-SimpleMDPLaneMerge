AA288 Final Project: Safe Lane Merging for Autonomous Cars on the Freeway through Markov Decision Process

1. Download all the .py files
2. Run Simulator2.py with config.py to get Simulation Rollout Data
3. Run Qlearning, SARSA, Double Qlearning algorithms to get best policy outputs for given rollout data.
